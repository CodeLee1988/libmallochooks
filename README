libmallochooks

This contains some include files and (not yet finished...) some make 
rules that will let you build a customised malloc instrumentation 
library out of some high-level hook definitions.

For now it supports glibc's malloc hooks and alternatively a generic 
LD_PRELOAD approach.  If you want to compose multiple sets of hooks, you 
have to write the linker command yourself at the moment, but the code is 
written to support chaining without (hopefully) any editing of the 
source. Building the LD_PRELOAD option also requires --defsym'ing 
__wrap_{malloc,...} to their unprefixed names. I will hopefully fix this 
soon....

This is intended to obsolete the malloc_hooks.c file that can be found 
on my web page. Until I finish the Makerules, the former will be easier 
to use, but is glibc-specific.

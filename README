libmallochooks

This contains some include files and make rules that will let you build
a customised malloc instrumentation  library out of some high-level hook
definitions.

For now it supports glibc's (deprecated) malloc hooks, a generic
load-time LD_PRELOAD approach and a generic compile/link-time wrapper
approach.

There's no documentation as yet, but you can see an example of their use
in liballocs <https://github.com/stephenrkell/liballocs/>: look at
malloc_hook_stubs_*.o rules in src/Makefile, and at heap_index_hooks.c.
